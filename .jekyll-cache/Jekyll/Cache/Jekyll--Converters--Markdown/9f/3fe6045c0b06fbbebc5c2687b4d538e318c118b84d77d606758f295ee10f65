I"N<p>I am using Linux as a desktop system for quite some time now. Starting with a distribution of SuSE dual-booting on my Windows 95 gaming machine some years past, it eventually became my main system, although I also had short stints with Windows 2000, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 (which I think is a really good operating system).</p>
