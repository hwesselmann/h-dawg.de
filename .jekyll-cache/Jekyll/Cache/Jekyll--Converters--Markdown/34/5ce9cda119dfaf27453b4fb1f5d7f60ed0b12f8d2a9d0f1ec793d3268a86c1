I"Ñ<p>In May I have bought a <a href="http://www.jolla.com">Jolla</a> smartphone preordering option. In August Jolla sent me a nice T-Shirt showing â€œI am the first oneâ€, some stickers and a letter saying â€œThank youâ€. I was not sure if I really wanted to get a new smartphone - my Lumia 820 was running fine and I had a whole bunch of webOS-phones ready to run as backups. The mission Jolla was on was nevertheless fascinating, so I wanted to support them.</p>
