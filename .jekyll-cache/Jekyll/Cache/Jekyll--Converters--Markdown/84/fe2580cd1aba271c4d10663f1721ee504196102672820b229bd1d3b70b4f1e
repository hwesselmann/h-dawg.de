I"Ù<p>Tomorrow I will get a new car. Not for the fun of it - since being father to four kids, we need a car that is able of moving all six of us. this shiny new car has an USB port which enables me to put in an USB memory stick and play the music placed on it as if it were an audio cd. This sounds great, doesnâ€™t it? No more joggling with joggling with CDs, no more problems with cleaning and carrying discs around and moving the right tunes from one car to the other.</p>
