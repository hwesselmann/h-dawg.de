I"≤<p>Finally I could spend some time to play around with FirefoxOS - I have ordered an <a href="http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.congstar.de%2Fhandy%2Falcatel-one-touch-fire-weiss-gruen%2F&amp;ei=f9OJUq6XO4bsswbM7YD4Cg&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6cpdtHZBLL-KsJ8IlGmsPY9uC9w&amp;bvm=bv.56643336,d.bGE">Alcatel One Touch Fire</a> (colored green, of course) and am awaiting its delivery.</p>

<p>I have put up a simple and small app project, creating a cartoon reader for my favorite strip - ‚ÄúDilbert‚Äù by Scott Adams. It has little features. I wanted to start playing around with HTML5-apps and also tried to estabish a development environment using <a href="http://harpjs.com">harpjs</a>. When thinking about starting this, I wanted to use <a href="http://www.enyojs">enyojs</a> which is targeting web-applications built for cross-plattform deployment. After setting up the bootplate, I found myself thinking the app I wanted to create was a little too small to bring in a full-fledged javascript framework, so I started over using just plain javascript.</p>

<p>I have put the source code up on my <a href="https://github.com/hwesselmann/dailydilbert-firefoxos">github</a>. It is lacking documentation and needs some refinements and features. I will use it to get into web app development, so it might grow into a more usable experience in the coming months‚Ä¶</p>
