I" <p>Since LG presented their (cool!) new Smart-TVs powered by <strong>webOS</strong>, my beloved operating system is trending again. Reviews were positive in general and one must admin that the system looks very promising. In hope to fuel webOS rising again (at least in social media), I have played around with twitter bots on my MSI Windbox running archlinux and created a <a href="https://twitter.com/rtwebos">little bot</a> retweeting things tagged with the webos-hashtag. Due to a bad coincidence of a similar term existing in (Mexican?) slang, there also might be tweets in that timeline not quite covering technology, but hopefully, those are not taking overâ€¦</p>
