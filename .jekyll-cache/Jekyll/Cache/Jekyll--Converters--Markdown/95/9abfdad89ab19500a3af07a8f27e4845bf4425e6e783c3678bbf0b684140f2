I"™<p>After having my blog running with <a href="http://harpjs.com">harpjs</a> for about a week and having pushed the basic structure to <a href="https://github.com/hwesselmann/hb-hdawg-blog">github</a> for everybody to use as they wish (if they wish toâ€¦), I found it would be great to organize my tags in a tag cloud rather than showing them in an unhandy list - as the amount of tags used grows, this list view is not useful at all to anybody (unless you are searching the page with the browsers built-in search functionality). I still have the list style active on <a href="http://blog.h-dawg.de">my archived blog in German</a> if you like to see an example.</p>
