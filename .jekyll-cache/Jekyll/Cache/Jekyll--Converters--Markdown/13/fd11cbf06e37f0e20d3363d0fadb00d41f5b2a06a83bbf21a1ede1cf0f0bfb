I"M<p>Some time ago, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> sponsor Canonical announced that they were bringing their operating system to mobile phones and tablets. Following this announcement, people were waiting for device coming with Ubuntu, and after a long waiting, Spanish manufacturer <a href="http://www.bq.com">bq</a> is the first to bring a device coming preinstalled with Ubuntu for phones. As they are only bringing small batches to the market, you can get one of those phones in so-called flash sales, announced on social media, lasting while there are devices in stock.</p>
