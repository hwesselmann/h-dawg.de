I"y<p>In February of 2012 I set up an instance of <a href="http://www.owncloud.org">ownCloud</a>, an selfhostable cloud-solution written in php. It was a good feeling to have it around to store my files, calendars and contacts not needing some service provider I knew too little about to be able to judge if they are trustworthy - like Google, Dropbox, Box.net or Zumo Drive.</p>
