<div>As you are viewing this page right now, you probably want to know who made up this site.</div>
<div>I was born in 1978 in Germany. Currently, I am living in Dorsten (Cologne area as LinkedIn would put it), a small town about 100km north-east of Cologne.</div>
<div>After finishing school and completeing my mandatory service in the German army, I started my job training at a small company in Bergisch Gladbach (which actually is really close to Cologne) and finished with the handy job title of <em>Fachinformtiker fÃ¼r Anwendungsentwicklung</em> - software developer, that is.</div>
<div>After this small company was sold to another only marginally bigger company, I worked as a network administrator for about two years before deciding to go for a degree at university.</div>
<div>In January of 2008 I completed my studies at the <a href="http://www.inf.fh-dortmund.de">University of Applied Sciences at Dortmund</a> and am eligible to carry the title '<em>Bachelor of Science in Health Informatics</em>'. I gained some experience working in the IT department of a statutory health insurance as a Java Developer and Project Manager and as an IT consultant in a consulting agency. Currently I am working as a <del>Project Manager for software projects</del> <del>ScrumMaster</del> Software Developer in a larger company focused on services built around performing billing tasks for energy consumption in properties (among many other things related to managing properties).</div>
<div>I was infected by Linux after first getting in touch with it in 1998, also I got deeper interest in mobile operating systems (especially the now-dead Palm webOS and SailfishOS by <a href="http://www.jolla.com">Jolla</a>) and web technologies.</div>
<div>Other things in my daily life are typical things that are a bit nerdy - Dilbert, Starwars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, unhealthy food &amp; Coke...</div>
<div>In the real world, I enjoy doing things that are not related to IT at all. Most of these activities involve spending time with my 4 kids (and sometimes with my wife). I play Tennis as a hobby and travel around the country watching Tennis matches of my kids (who play far better at young age than I will ever be capable of).</div>
<h3>why 'h-dawg.de' ?</h3>
<div>Sounds like a dumb domain name - yeah, you're probably right.</div>
<div>How did it happen that I have chosen this name? Someone gave that nickname to me while I was on a student exchange in the United States (I was a really cool hip-hopping b-boy at that time). Afterwards, I used <em>h-dawg</em> or <em>h.dawg</em> as a nickname for video games, mail accounts and online services. Of course I imediately secured the domain names, added some mail addresses and never got rid of all of that...</div>
<div>This site used to host the pages of my basketball team followed by the website of the complete basketball club. For a short period, I even hosted a pure static personal homepage. Since 2005 this was the place I put my blog live. It was powered by Wordpress and had about 300 posts - all in German. When I realized I do not need the power of Wordpress to cover my needs for a personal (low traffic) site, I started migrating my blog to <a href="http://ghost.org">ghost</a>. While this was in progress, I decided to start over and create a wild mixture of German and English posts while trying to cover different topics. Since I spend more time playing around with technology than creating content, I next moved to a static site generator again - the last version of this website was created using the great <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site generator. Currently, I moved back to Wordpress. For how long will that last? I really don't know...</div>

<div>Thanks for reading this far, I hope you enjoy my site!</div>
