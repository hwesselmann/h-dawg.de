I"¬<p>Last week RTJolla, one of my main sources for information about <a href="http://www.jolla.com">Jolla</a> on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/RTJolla/status/491651084323000320">has died</a> - probably not  forever, but maybe for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>I am not big fan of creating listings and searches on twitter, I just want to read my timeline, so I created a twitter to account to jump in until RTJolla returns. <a href="https://twitter.com/JollaBot">This bot</a> has been created for my personal usage will retweet everything it finds about Jolla and SailfishOS - the operating system powering the Jolla smartphone.</p>

<p>Maybe it is useful for you too :-)</p>
