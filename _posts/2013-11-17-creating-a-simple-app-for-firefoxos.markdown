Finally I could spend some time to play around with FirefoxOS - I have ordered an [Alcatel One Touch Fire](http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CC4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.congstar.de%2Fhandy%2Falcatel-one-touch-fire-weiss-gruen%2F&ei=f9OJUq6XO4bsswbM7YD4Cg&usg=AFQjCNF6cpdtHZBLL-KsJ8IlGmsPY9uC9w&bvm=bv.56643336,d.bGE) (colored green, of course) and am awaiting its delivery. 

I have put up a simple and small app project, creating a cartoon reader for my favorite strip - "Dilbert" by Scott Adams. It has little features. I wanted to start playing around with HTML5-apps and also tried to estabish a development environment using [harpjs](http://harpjs.com). When thinking about starting this, I wanted to use [enyojs](http://www.enyojs) which is targeting web-applications built for cross-plattform deployment. After setting up the bootplate, I found myself thinking the app I wanted to create was a little too small to bring in a full-fledged javascript framework, so I started over using just plain javascript.

I have put the source code up on my [github](https://github.com/hwesselmann/dailydilbert-firefoxos). It is lacking documentation and needs some refinements and features. I will use it to get into web app development, so it might grow into a more usable experience in the coming months...
