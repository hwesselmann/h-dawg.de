Last week RTJolla, one of my main sources for information about [Jolla](http://www.jolla.com) on twitter [has died](https://twitter.com/RTJolla/status/491651084323000320) - probably not  forever, but maybe for a longer period of time.

I am not big fan of creating listings and searches on twitter, I just want to read my timeline, so I created a twitter to account to jump in until RTJolla returns. [This bot](https://twitter.com/JollaBot) has been created for my personal usage will retweet everything it finds about Jolla and SailfishOS - the operating system powering the Jolla smartphone.

Maybe it is useful for you too :-)
